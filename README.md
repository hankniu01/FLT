## Abstract
Financial volatility prediction is vital for characterizing a companyâ€™s risk profile. Transcripts of companiesâ€™ earnings calls serve as valuable, yet unstructured, data sources to be utilized to access companiesâ€™ performance and risk profiles. Despite their importance, current works ignore the role of financial metrics knowledge (such as EBIT, EPS, and ROI) in transcripts, which is crucial for understanding companiesâ€™ performance, and little consideration is given to integrating text and price information. In this work, we statistically analyze common financial metrics and create a special dataset centered on these metrics. Then, we propose a knowledge-enhanced financial volatility prediction method (KeFVP) to inject knowledge of financial metrics into text comprehension by knowledge-enhanced adaptive pre-training (KePt) and effectively integrating text and price information by introducing a conditional time series prediction module. Extensive experiments are conducted on three realworld public datasets, and the results indicate that KeFVP is effective and outperforms all the state-of-the-art methods.
